# Code-Quiz

For this assignement, we were given a task to create a quiz using facts that we have learned from JavaScript.

The elements that we used for this assignment are HTML, CSS and JS.

Steps Taken to Create the Coding Quiz:

1. The first step that was taken to begin this assignment was to create the HTML file first. In the HTML file we made sure to llink it to both the CSS and JS.

2. After the HTML was complete and had all the elements that we needed, we then moved on to the CSS.

3. In the CSS, we linked all the HTML and CSS so we could get the attributes we needed to make the Coding Quiz look up to the acceptance criteria.

4. Once the CSS file was complete, it was time to create the JS elements that we needed in order to manipulate the HTML to the way that we wanted.

5. In the JS file, we created a timer function and question functions so that the questions would be displayed with their options.

6. We also manipulated the timer to deduct time when the user would get a question wrong.
